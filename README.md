# nomics-test
This is a test project to get cryptocurrencies from nomics api

# Over view
I have created spec file as I need to test my funtions
There are two funtions
  1. get_currencies (We can use this funtion to get currencies in which first arguement include currencies name with seprated comma and 2nd argument is for specific        attributes and third one is for to get currency in specific fiot)
  2. convert_currency (Convert one cryptocurrency to other like 1BTH equal to 14.66ETM by usd dollars)
 
 I have written 4 test cases for each task and if you want to verify the results, you can use Rspec assetions
 
 # Note
 Specific attributes are not working with free api key if you want to get manually, you can do by iterating result and get specific result
 
 So I have added get_attributes funtion
